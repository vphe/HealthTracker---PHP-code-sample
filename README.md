# HealthTracker - PHP code sample.

Application measures the Biomarkers (Pulse/Heart rate, Blood pressure, Body temperature) and matches it with existing diagnoses, which contain the matching values for each Biomarker.

The application was written for hackathon project and worked with the date from Postgres DB, in this example the values are generated.

Real data to Postgres DB was provided by mobile app, through the different part of application.
